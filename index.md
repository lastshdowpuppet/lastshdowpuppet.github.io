Hi!

This page is inspired by [yacine's online notes page](https://yacine.ca/). It is similar in spirit. I will post thoughts and work-in-progress here, though I think anything presentable will go on my irl github page. This site is meant more as an online journal, a collection of unstructured thoughts and notes. Notes on this page will always be about the current month. For previous notes, see archives.(TODO: add link to archive page)

TODO:
- add link to notable pages on the internet
- structure bookmarks

Introduction:
Hi I'm amon. I'm just starting a Master's degree in Computer Science. I have a bachelor's degree in CS and have worked as a software engineer for slightly longer than a year at the time of this writing (May 2024). I didn't learn much during my bachelor's and I'm hoping to rectify that now. This page will be an irregularly updated chronicle of my journey. Right now my goal is to figure out what area of CS/adjacent fields I like best and specialize in that. I am interested in math, physics, biology, economics, history, and philosophy. I'm hoping to learn to draw and paint properly and learn how to play a musical instrument sometime in the next few years.
